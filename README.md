# Python ODE Solver Program

This program solves and plots solutions for two specific ordinary differential equations (ODEs): `y'' + 4y = 0` and `y'' + y = 0`, along with their respective Green's function solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Python 3.x on your computer.
* You have a Python IDE (such as PyCharm, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, or any other) installed on your computer.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the necessary Python libraries:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.).
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
    ```

This will install NumPy (for numerical operations), Matplotlib (for plotting graphs), and SciPy (for scientific computations, if needed).

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open your Python IDE.
2. Create a new Python file in your IDE.
3. Copy the content of the provided Python script into the new file.
4. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `odeSolver.py`.
5. Run the script in your IDE:

## Viewing the Results

After running the program, four plots should appear on your screen:
1. Homogeneous solution for `y'' + 4y = 0`.
2. Homogeneous solution for `y'' + y = 0`.
3. Green's function solution for `y'' + 4y = x`.
4. Green's function solution for `y'' + y = 4`.
